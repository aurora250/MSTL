# Third-Party Notices

NexusForce itself is distributed under the MIT License (see [LICENSE](LICENSE)).

This file reproduces the copyright notices and license texts of third-party
material that is **included in, or linked into, NexusForce binaries**. It exists
because the MIT License alone does not satisfy the attribution requirements of
the licenses below, which oblige distributors of *binary* forms (for example a
shipped `libNexusForce.so`, `NexusForce.dll` or `libNexusForce.dylib`) to
reproduce the notices as well. Keep this file alongside any binary distribution.

## 1. Ported source code

### moodycamel::ConcurrentQueue

`include/NeForce/core/async/lock_free_queue.hpp` is a port of
[moodycamel::ConcurrentQueue](https://github.com/cameron314/concurrentqueue)
(2020 version), adapted to the NexusForce code style and components.

### Bit Twiddling Hacks

The round-up-to-power-of-two helper in
`include/NeForce/core/async/lock_free_queue.hpp` follows the technique published
in [Bit Twiddling Hacks](https://graphics.stanford.edu/~seander/bithacks.html)

## 2. Linked third-party libraries

NexusForce links the libraries below. On platforms where they are linked
**statically** (the vcpkg default for several of them), their code is embedded in
NexusForce binaries and the corresponding license text must be reproduced by the
distributor. When they are linked dynamically, they are separate works and their
licenses apply to those libraries themselves.

### Note on libmysql

The MySQL client library is distributed under **GPL-2.0-only with the Universal
FOSS Exception**, not a permissive license. It is an *optional* dependency
controlled by `NEXUSFORCE_ENABLE_MYSQL` (`config.json` → `dependency.mysql.switch`).
Anyone redistributing a NexusForce binary built with MySQL support enabled should
confirm that the intended distribution satisfies the GPL, or build with
`-DNEXUSFORCE_ENABLE_MYSQL=OFF`.
